All data was collected from public official resources (World Bank, National Bureau of Statistics, etc.). Due to the limitation of accessible data, I would use the following indicators to build the model: fertility (total birth per woman), life expectancy at birth (in years), university recruitment per 10k, urban population ratio, infant mortality (death per 10k before 3 weeks old), disposable income (in CNY), Consumer Price Index (CPI, 2010 standardized) were taken into account. There are 34 observations from 1989 to 2022.
